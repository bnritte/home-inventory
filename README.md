# Home Inventory app with Node and React

## Purpose

Use this app to keep track of the items that you own. Your home inventory can serve as documentation of asset values for insurance coverage and claims and for charitable contributions. Alternatively, use the app as a wish list of items that you *want* to purchase or receive as a gift. Or if you&rsquo;re a follower of the [voluntary simplicity lifestyle](http://www.choosingvoluntarysimplicity.com/), use the app to become more aware of *how little* you own and the future purchases you want to avoid.
