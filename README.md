# Home Inventory app with Node and React

## Purpose

Provide users with an easy way to maintain an inventory of the items that they own. There are several benefits of maintaining this type of inventory. The most obvious benefit is that it serves as documentation of asset values for insurance coverage and claims and for charitable contributions. A secondary benefit is that an inventory of assets can allow users following a [voluntary simplicity lifestyle](http://www.choosingvoluntarysimplicity.com/) to become more aware of their purchases.
